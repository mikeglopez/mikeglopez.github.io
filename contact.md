<!-- Jekyll is a great tool to create static sites, but there’s no backend to send your data to.

However, you can use free SaaS as a backend for forms, such as [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to handle form submissions. Sleek has a configured form using formspree ready for you. All you have to do is change the email in `.config.yml`.

Check the form below to see it in action! -->

<!-- ### Example Formspree contact form with validation and reCaptcha -->

Send me a message and let's chat! [email me at mikeglopez@me.com](mailto:{{site.email}}).
