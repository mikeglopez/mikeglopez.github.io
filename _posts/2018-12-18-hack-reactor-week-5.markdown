A strange place to begin a blog, but here we are. Today was the beginning of Week 5 of the Remote Part Time [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/) program. This program is a coding bootcamp that helps to build "autonomous, capable software engineers that employers are looking for." [Hack Reactor](https://getcoding.hackreactor.com/remote-part-time/). A new, more challenging sprint is introduced each Monday and we work in pairs to complete it, ideally by the end of class on Saturday. This week, we are continuing to work on algorithms with a chess-based app. I've gotten used to feeling completely lost on as we begin working on Mondays, but it's a really cool experience, because by Saturday, while I don't feel like an expert in the material, I have a much better understanding of the skills or technologies introduced that week. With 5 weeks down and another 33 or so to go, I'm excited to see how much I'll grow as a fullstack software engineer.
