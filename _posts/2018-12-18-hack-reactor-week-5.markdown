Today was the beginning of Week 5 of the Remote Part Time Hack Reactor program and I'm starting to get used to feeling completely lost on Mondays when new sprints are introduced. We're continuing to work on algorithms and it's really getting tough. So far, every week has been increasingly challenging and exciting. We'll see how the week goes.
